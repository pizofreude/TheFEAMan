Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool for solving complex engineering problems. But sometimes, it can also be a source of frustration for engineers who struggle to set up the simulation correctly and obtain reliable results. Plus, FEA can be a frustrating process of trial and error to get the simulation to converge and produce accurate results. That’s why some people jokingly call FEA “Frustration Engineering Algorithm”. In this repository, we will share some tips and tricks to make FEA less frustrating and hopefully more rewarding.

## Contents Under Docs

But sometimes, it can also be a source of frustration for engineers who struggle to set up the simulation correctly and obtain reliable results. Plus, FEA can be a frustrating process of trial and error to get the simulation to converge and produce accurate results. That\u2019s why some people jokingly call FEA \u201cFrustration Engineering Algorithm\u201d. In this repository, we will share some tips and tricks to make FEA less frustrating and hopefully more rewarding.</p>"},{"location":"#contents-under-docs","title":"Contents Under Docs","text":"<p>The \"docs\" directory typically contains documentation related to the Finite Element Analysis software, analysis methods, or code.
